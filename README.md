    -   Design and build new applications in the cloud
-   ##### On-premises Deployment
    -   Deploy resources by using virtualization and resource management tools
    -   Increase resource utilization by using application management and virtualization technologies
-   ##### Hybrid Deployment
    -   Connect cloud-based resources to on-premises infrastructure
    -   Integrate cloud-based resources with legacy IT applications
