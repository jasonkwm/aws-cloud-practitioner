# AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (AWS CAF)
 **AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (AWS CAF)** organizes guidance into `six areas` of focus, called `Perspectives`. Each **Perspective** addresses `distinct responsibilities`.   
 **In general**, the `Business`, `People`, and `Governance Perspectives` focus on `business capabilities`.  
 Whereas the `Platform`, `Security`, and `Operations` **Perspectives** focus on `technical capabilities`.

 ## Business Capabilities
 
### Business Perspective
- Ensures that IT `aligns` with business needs and that `IT investments link` to `key business results`.  
- Create a `strong business case` for cloud adoption and `prioritize cloud adoption initiatives`.   
- `Common roles` in the **Business Perspective** include: 
  - `Business managers`, `Finance managers`, `Budget owners`, `Strategy stakeholders`

### People Perspective
- `Supports development` of an organization-wide change `management strategy` for `successful cloud adoption`
- `Evaluate organizational structures` and roles, new skill and process requirements, and identify gaps
- `Helps prioritize` training, staffing, and organizational changes
- `Common roles` in the **People Perspective** include:
  - `Human resources`, `Staffing`, `People managers`
### Governance Perspective
- Focuses on the skills and processes to `align IT strategy` with `business strategy`
- `Maximize` the `business value` and `minimize risks`
- `Understand how` to update the `staff skills` and processes necessary to ensure `business governance in the cloud`
- `Common roles` in the **Governance Perspective** include:
  - `Chief Information Officer (CIO)`, `Program managers`, `Enterprise architects`, `Business analysts`, `Portfolio managers`


 ## Technical Capabilities

### Platform Perspective
- Principles and patterns for `implementing new solutions` on the cloud, and `migrating on-premises workloads` to the cloud
- Use a variety of `architectural models` to `understand and communicate` the structure of `IT systems and their relationships`
- `Common roles` in the **Platform Perspective** include: 
  - `Chief Technology Officer (CTO)`, `IT managers`, `Solutions architects`
### Security Perspective
- Ensures that the organization meets `security objectives` for `visibility`, `auditability`, `control`, and `agility`
- `Structure` the `selection and implementation` of `security controls` that meet the organization’s needs
- `Common roles` in the **Security Perspective** include:
  - `Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)`, `IT security managers`, `IT security analysts`
### Operations Perspective
- `Enable`, `run`, `use`, `operate`, and `recover IT workloads` to the level agreed upon with your `business stakeholders`
- Define how `day-to-day`, `quarter-to-quarter`, and `year-to-year` business is conducted
- `Helps stakeholders` define current `operating procedures` and identify the `process changes` and `training needed` to implement `successful cloud adoption`
- `Common roles` in the **Operations Perspective** include:
- `IT operations managers`, `IT support managers`

# Migration Strategies
## 6 strategies for migration
`Six` of the most common `migration strategies` that you can implement are:
- `Rehosting`, `Replatforming`, `Refactoring/re-architecting`, `Repurchasing`, `Retaining`, `Retiring`

### Rehosting
- Also known as `lift-and-shift` involves `moving applications without changes`

### Replatforming
- Also known as `lift, tinker, and shift,` involves making a `few cloud optimizations` to realize a `tangible benefit`
- Optimization` is achieved `without changing` the `core architecture` of the application

### Refactoring/re-architecting
- Involves `reimagining how` an application is `architected and developed` by using `cloud-native features`
- Driven by a **strong business need** to `add features`, `scale`, or `performance` that would otherwise be difficult to achieve in the `application’s existing environment`

### Repurchasing
- `Moving` from a `traditional license` to a `software-as-a-service` model
### Retaining
- Keeping applications that are `critical` for the business in the `source environment`
- Include applications that `require major refactoring` before they can be `migrated`, or, work that can be postponed until a later time

### Retiring
- Process of `removing applications` that are `no longer needed`
