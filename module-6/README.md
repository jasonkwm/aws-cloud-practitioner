# AWS Shared Responsibility Model
The shared responsibility model divides into `customer responsibilities` (commonly referred to as **“security in the cloud”**) and `AWS responsibilities` (commonly referred to as **“security of the cloud”**).

### Customers: Security in the cloud
- Customers are `responsible` for the `security of everything` that they `create and put` in the **AWS Cloud**
- You, the customer, `maintain complete control` over your content
- You are `responsible` for `managing security requirements` for your content and `who has access` to that content
- You also `control` how `access rights` are `granted`, `managed`, and `revoked`


### AWS: Security of the cloud
- AWS is `responsible` for security of the cloud
- AWS `operates, manages, and controls` the components at `all layers` of infrastructure
- AWS is `responsible` for protecting the `global infrastructure` that runs all of the `services offered` in the AWS Cloud
- AWS `manages` the security of the cloud, specifically the `physical infrastructure` that hosts your resources
