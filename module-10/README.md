# The AWS Well-Architected Framework
- Helps you understand `how to design and operate` `reliable`, `secure`, `efficient`, and `cost-effective systems` in the **AWS Cloud**
- Provides a way to `consistently measure` your architecture against `best practices` and `design principles` and `identify areas for improvement`
- The **Well-Architected Framework** is based on `six pillars`:
  - `Operational excellence`, `Security`, `Reliability`, `Performance efficiency`, `Cost optimization`, `Sustainability`
 
### Operational excellence
- Ability to `run and monitor systems` to `deliver business value` and to continually improve `supporting processes` and `procedures`
- Performing operations as `code`, `annotating documentation`, `anticipating failure`, and frequently making small, `reversible changes`

### Security
- Ability to `protect information`, `systems`, and `assets` while delivering business value through `risk assessments` and `mitigation strategies`
- When considering the security of your architecture, apply these best practices:
  - `Automate security` best practices when possible
  - Apply security at `all layers`
  - `Protect data` in transit and at rest

### Reliability
- Ability of a system to do the following:
  - `Recover` from infrastructure or service disruptions
  - `Dynamically` acquire computing `resources to meet demand`
  - `Mitigate disruptions` such as `misconfigurations` or `transient network issues`
- Reliability includes `testing recovery procedures`, `scaling horizontally` to increase aggregate system availability, and `automatically recovering` from failure

### Performance efficiency
- Ability to use `computing resources efficiently` to meet system requirements and to maintain that efficiency as `demand changes` and `technologies evolve`
- `Experimenting more often`, using `serverless architectures`, and `designing systems` to be able to `go global in minutes`

### Cost optimization
- Ability to `run systems` to `deliver business value` at the `lowest price` point
- `Cost optimization` includes adopting a `consumption model`, `analyzing` and `attributing expenditure`, and using `managed services` to reduce the cost of ownership

### Sustainability
- Ability to continually `improve sustainability impacts` by `reducing energy consumption` and `increasing efficiency` across all components of a workload by maximizing the benefits from the `provisioned resources` and `minimizing the total resources required`
- To facilitate good design for sustainability:
  - Understand your `impact`
  - Establish sustainability `goals`
  - Maximize `utilization`
  - `Anticipate and adopt` new, more efficient hardware and software offerings
  - Use `managed services`
  - Reduce the `downstream impact` of your cloud workloads

# Benefits of the AWS Cloud
## Advantages of cloud computing
**AWS Cloud** offers many benefits over computing in `on-premises` or `hybrid environments`  

#### Six advantages of cloud computing:
- Trade `upfront expense` for `variable expense`
  - No need buy hardware, only use and pay for what u need 
- Benefit from `massive economies of scale`
  - More people use, cheaper service becomes
- Stop `guessing capacity`
  - If u need only u buy more power
- Increase `speed and agility`
  - It says here more flexible, more time to do other stuff
- Stop spending money `running and maintaining data centers`
  - No need buy aircond and other hard stuff to run server, no need maintenance
- Go `global in minutes`
  - AWS server around the world, easy to launch at murica and singapo
