# AWS Free Tier
- Enables you to begin using certain services without having to worry about incurring costs for the specified period.
- `Three types` of offers are available: `Always Free`, `12 Months Free`, `Trial`
### Always Free
These offers `do not expire` and are `available to all` AWS customers.  
**Example:**
- **AWS Lambda** allows *1 million* `free requests` and up to *3.2 million seconds* of `compute time` per month
- **Amazon DynamoDB** allows *25 GB* of `free storage` per month

### 12 Months Free
These offers are `free for 12 months` following your `initial sign-up` date to AWS.  
**Examples:**
- Specific amounts of **Amazon S3 Standard Storage**
- Thresholds for `monthly hours` of **Amazon EC2** `compute time`
- Amounts of **Amazon CloudFront** `data transfer out`

### Trials
`Short-term free trial` offers start from the date you `activate a particular service`. The `length` of each trial might vary by `number of days` or the `amount of usage` in the service.  
**Examples:**
- **Amazon Inspector** offers a `90-day` free trial
- **Amazon Lightsail** (a service that enables you to run virtual private servers) offers `750 free hours` of usage over a `30-day` period

# AWS Pricing Concepts

## How AWS pricing works
AWS offers a range of cloud computing services with `pay-as-you-go` pricing.

### Pay for what you use
For each service, you pay for exactly the amount of resources that you actually use, `without requiring long-term contracts` or `complex licensing`. 
### Pay less when you reserve
Some services offer `reservation options` that provide a `significant discount` compared to `On-Demand Instance pricing`.
### Pay less with volume-based discounts when you use more
Some services offer `tiered pricing`, so the per-unit cost is `incrementally lower with increased usage`.

## AWS Pricing Calculator
- `Explore AWS services` and create an `estimate for the cost` of your use cases on AWS
- `Organize` your AWS estimates `by groups` that you define
- When you have `created an estimate`, you can `save it` and `generate a link` to `share it` with others
